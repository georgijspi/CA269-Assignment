## Description
Given a keypad and an n digit number provided by user, working in groups of 4, write a Java program to list (in alphabetical order) all letter combinations which are possible by pressing these digits.

For example, if the input number is: 234

The output should be:
adg adh adi aeg aeh aei afg afh afi
bdg bdh bdi beg beh bei bfg bfh bfi
cdg cdh cdi ceg ceh cei cfg cfh cfi

## Work Breakdown
We decided to work on our own solutions to the problem individually. We did so on separate branches within the same repo. Each branch was labelled after the person who worked on it. After working on solutions for about a week, we came together and looked through our individual code - comparing different elements and eventually merging into the final solution.

Jed had the best solution to the generateCombos() problem, so his was used. Rishab's running loop in main() was used along with Georgijs's generateWords() feature. Both the main() and generateWords() functions were refactored and commented by Jed for efficiency and readability.
